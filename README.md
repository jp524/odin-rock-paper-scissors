# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

Built as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum.

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that can be played using the console. Type `game()` to play!

You'll be asked to a choice of "rock", "paper" or "scissors" (using lowercase or capital - it does not matter). There are five rounds to the game. The winner of each round is displayed via the console.

At the end of the game, the score and winner are displayed.

## Improvement Ideas

* Handle user input that is not "rock", "paper" or "scissors" 

* Add GUI
